# BlackJack-python
Blackjack game I made using python.

You have to run the import cell, otherwise the cell after doesn't work. Make sure you type "hit" and "stand" correctly, otherwise the code will tell you to re-enter it correctly. It works like a regular black jack game, just nothing to stake, so its all for fun! Please leave a review if you liked this!
